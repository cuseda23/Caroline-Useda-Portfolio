This repostiory contains the work from my academic and research positions held during my time at Amherst College, aimed toward perspective employers. Information about specific projects are available in their respective class/program folders. Code for STAT classes is in R while COSC classes are in Java, with the exception of Machine Learning, which is in Python.
