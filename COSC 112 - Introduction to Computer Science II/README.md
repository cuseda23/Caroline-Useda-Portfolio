Completed Spring 2021 as part of Introduction to Computer Science II. For this final project, we were tasked with implementing a matching program for medical residency. In this situation, both medical students and hospitals provide ranked list, and we were to write a method that creates the best matching for both parties. Agent.java, Pair.java, and Matching.Java were the methods I wrote as part of this project.
